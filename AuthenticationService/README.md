## Authentication Service

This project was used as part of a talk at West Midlands Java User Group in May on securing
microservices using JSON Web Tokens.

  Most of the code is my own, however, I have borrowed 3 classes (SecretService, JWTResponse and PublicCredentials) from
  StormPath's repo https://github.com/stormpath/JavaRoadStorm2016/tree/master/roadstorm-jwt-microservices-tutorial

  This code is purely for an example and definitely shouldn't be used in production!

  The other project that you will need for this demo is PreferredFilmService.
